# riot-auth

The goal of this project is to bypass Cloudflare's filters (403, error code: 1020).  
To do this TLS 1.3 cipher suites and signature algorithms are set via ctypes using Python's bundled libssl in `RiotAuth.create_riot_auth_ssl_ctx()`.  
Currently HTTP/2 is not being used as HTTP/1.1 does not appear to be an issue, ...and aiohttp does not support it.

# Updating User Agents
The class variable can be modified at runtime like this:
```py
from riot_auth import RiotAuth

RiotAuth.RIOT_CLIENT_USER_AGENT = "UPDATED USER AGENT STRING GOES HERE"
#EXAMPLE
# RiotAuth.RIOT_CLIENT_USER_AGENT = "RiotClient/87.0.2.1547.3551 %s (Windows;10;;Professional, x64)"
```

If you have no idea how to update it;  
Currently [Officer's Valorant-API](https://dash.valorant-api.com/) can be used to get the Riot Client version, use the [/version](https://valorant-api.com/v1/version) endpoint and look for the `riotClientBuild` key in the response.
With this you can create a task/simple function that updates the `RIOT_CLIENT_USER_AGENT` class variable.

> I will soon create a pipeline to update the user-agent automatically, currently they are up to date
